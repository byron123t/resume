        \CVItem{Creating automated data collection and annotation methods for training vision-language models to achieve above-human performance on in-the-wild text recognition tasks ($>$10k samples).~\cite{hawkeye}}
        \CVItem{Designed a real-time software privacy film for smartphones, Eye-Shield. Reduced attack rates to 24.24\% for images and 15.91\% for text, protecting against screen snooping on smartphones.~\cite{ShoulderSurfing}}
        \CVItem{Developed various LLM web automation tools and document parsers for auditing data collection activities~\cite{steward}. Deployed automated analysis of 47.2k Chrome Web Store extensions~\cite{BrowserExtensions}, 2.9k online trackers~\cite{OptOutChk}, and 1.4k cookie banners~\cite{ConsentChk}, finding many instances of misleading disclosures and non-compliance.}
        \CVItem{Built and evaluated an LLM chatbot engine using GPT-4o and GPT-3.5 for serving personalized advertisements. Ran a user study with 179 participants, finding users were 13.07\% more influenced by the LLM serving ads compared to the control. Undisclosed advertising led to 19.05\% more positive reactions to products.~\cite{chatbotads}}
        \CVItem{Served as server admin, social organizer, equipment curator, and mentoring role for the Real-Time Computing Lab.}
